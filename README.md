# spam email classification
A Spam Email Classification project involves developing a system that can automatically distinguish between spam (unwanted or unsolicited emails) and ham (legitimate emails). This is achieved by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze and classify email content.

Key Components of the Project:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham. Publicly available datasets, such as the SpamAssassin Public Corpus, are commonly used for this purpose.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the email text for analysis. This includes removing HTML tags, special characters, and stop words, as well as performing tokenization and normalization.

Feature Extraction: Convert the processed text into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) are often employed to represent the importance of words in the emails.

Model Training: Select and train machine learning models to classify emails. Common algorithms used include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests.

Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in determining the effectiveness of the classifier in identifying spam emails.
